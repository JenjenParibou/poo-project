- Maybe have it so that you can only have buildings in an area if you have basic units on that area


- Maybe have terrain type affect how many ressources you get from that case
For example getting more ores from mountain areas but less food, or getting more food
from areas with water but less ores


- Batiment is an abstract class that all other buildings inherit from, perhaps
buildings that produce ressources should inherit from another abstract class
(This would help my previous idea)

So it would go
	Batiment
		Command Center 
		Training Ground
		Batiment Ressources
			Farm
			Mine
			Other
			
- Possible loss condition: Command center getting destroyed

- Basic gameplay loop: Have money being generated periodically, letting you build building, buildings 
will give you ressources that lets you have units, units can travel far to build other buildings, more
buildings = more money generated

- Perhaps you

-Not sure how fights are gonna be like
